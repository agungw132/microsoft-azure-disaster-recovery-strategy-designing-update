    "Azure SQL Database. A general‑purpose, relational database provided as a managed service. With this type of database, we can create a high available and high‑performance data storage layer for the applications and solutions we are building on the Microsoft Azure. With the SQL database, we can build our modern cloud applications because it enables us to process both relational data and non‑relational structures as graphs, JSONs, or XML.\n",
    "\n",
    "Azure Cosmos DB. Nowadays, modern applications are required to be highly responsive and always online. To achieve low latency and high availability, instances of these applications needs to be deployed in the data centers that are close to their users. It's not so easy. Applications need to respond in real time to allow changes in usage at peak hours, start either increasing volumes of data, and make this data available to users in milliseconds. No one likes waiting for data. Azure Cosmos DB is the Microsoft's globally distributed multi‑model database service. Cosmos DB provides compression‑safe, service level agreements for throughput, latency, availability, and consistency guarantees, something no other database service offers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Microsoft Azure Storage is a cloud storage solution for modern data storage scenarios. Azure Storage offers a massively scalable object store for data objects, a file system service for the cloud, a messaging store for reliable messaging, and NoSQL store. Azure storage is durable and high available. Redundancy ensures that our data is safe in the event on transient hardware failures. It's also secured. All data written to Azure Storage is encrypted. It's scalable. Azure Storage is designed to be massively scalable to meet the data storage and performance needs of today's applications. In this module, we are going to talk about all these free services."

Multi‑master is composed of multiple master regions that equally participate in a write‑anywhere model active‑active pattern, and it is used to ensure that data is available at any time where we need it.

    "Demo time. We will enable geo‑redundancy and multi‑region writes in the Azure Cosmos DB. We will learn how to create Cosmos DB instance, how to enable geo‑redundancy, and how to enable multiple writes. Once we sign into the Azure Portal under the portal.azure.com, we click Create a resource button. In the Search Box, we have to type Cosmos DB and select Azure Cosmos DB from the drop‑down. In the next page, we click Create button. We start from creating a new resource group where Azure Cosmos DB will be provisioned. In this case, this will be rg‑ps‑cosmos. We have to scroll down and type unique name for the Cosmos DB account. In my case, this will be ps‑cosmos‑db. API and Apache Spark sections can be left without changes. From the Location drop‑down, I will select the closest region to me, so West Europe. Below, there are two very important sections, Geo‑Redundancy and Multi‑region Writes. If we enable geo‑redundancy data in our Cosmos DB, it will be replicated across paired regions, in this case, West Europe and North Europe. Of course, we can add more regions later. Let's enable geo‑redundancy. When multi‑master region writes is enabled, we can write the data across different Azure regions. We can enable it. Very important point to notice, enabling multi‑region writes is possible only when creating new Azure Cosmos DB account. Now we can click Networking button, and we can leave default settings. There will be no tags, so we can move to the Review + create tab. Here, after validation, we click Create button. To avoid waiting until the resources are provisioned, I forwarded the video. Once the Cosmos DB account is created, we can click go to resource button. We scroll down in the left bar and select Replicate data globally tab. This is the place where we can add or remove regions for our Azure Cosmos DB account to enable or disable geo‑replication of data. We can add one more region. So for instance, Canada is this time. We have to save changes by clicking the Save button. Azure Cosmos DB will automatically configure selected regions. After a few minutes, there should be confirmation. Now with the geo‑replication, our data is replicated across different regions. In case of disaster in the one region, we can still access the data from the second region."

For instance, for the web application, it can stop responding. We should also rate each failure mode according to its overall risk.

    "In this demo, we will see how to enable multiple Azure regions for the web application and how to create an Azure Front Door service and configure endpoints which support regional failover. Once we sign into the Azure Portal under portal.azure.com we click the Create a resource button. We will start from creating two separate Azure web apps available in different Azure regions. In the Search box we have to type web app and select Web Application. On the next page we click the Create button. There are a few details we have to fill. First of all we have to create a new resource group. To do it we click Create new and provide the name. In my case, this is rg‑pluralsight‑region1. Then we click the OK button. We have to also provide the name of the web app. In this case, psWebAppRegion1. So the app will be available under the psWebAppRegion1.azurewebsites.net URL. Then we have to select the Runtime stack. In this case, let's select .NET Core 2.2. A very important thing, we have to also set a region. In this case, we select East US. Now we have to scroll down and create a new App Service plan. To do it, we have to click Create new, and in the dialogue we have to type the name. In this case, it will be psAppServicePlanEastUsRegion1. Then we click the OK button. We can leave the rest of the settings as they are. So Sku and size is set to Standard S1. Now in the Monitoring tab we can disable Application Insights because we will not use them in this course. The Tags section can be also left empty. In the Review + create view we can see that Region for our web application is set to East US. We click the Create button to create the App Service plan together with web application. To avoid waiting until the resources are provisioned, I forwarded the video. Once the web application is created we can click the Go to resource button. In the Overview tab there are some details about the newly created web app like status, so it's running now; location, so East US; and also there is the URL address. Now we have to create the second App Service plan and web application, but this time in another Azure region, West Europe. I will copy the previous values to modify them during the creation of the second web app. Again, in the main tab we click Create a resource and search for the web app. We click the Create button, and in a displayed blade we have to fill some details like in the previous case. We have to create another resource group. This time it will be called, in my case, rg‑pluralsight‑region2. Once we type the name we click the OK button. Then, we scroll down and provide the web app name, so in this case, psWebAppRegion2. Runtime stack is set to .NET Core 2.2, but this time we set Region to West Europe. We have to also create a separate App Service plan. To do it we click Create new, and we have to type psAppServicePlanWestEuropeRegion2. Once we've typed the name for the App Service plan we click the OK button. The Sku and size section can be left as it is, set to Standard S1. In the Monitoring tab we can disable Application Insights because we will not use this service. We do not have to provide any tags. In the Review + create tab we click the Create button. To avoid waiting until the resources are provisioned, I forwarded the video. Once the web application is created we can click the Go to resource button. This time the application is available in the West Europe region and of course under a different URL. Now it's time to create Azure Front Door service. From the home tab we click the Create a resource button and in the Search box we can type front. From the drop‑down we select Front Door. In the next blade we have to click the Create button. There are a few details we have to fill. First of all we have to select or create our resource group. In this demo, we can use the resource group we created before for the first region, so rg‑pluralsight‑region1. Now, we can go to the Configuration tab. There, we have to provide more details. We click the Plus button on the Frontend hosts, and in the displayed tab we have to provide the host name to route the traffic. Our Front Door service will be available under psfrontend.azurefd.net. The rest of the configuration can stay as it is. We can click the Add button. For the Backend pools, which is step number two, we click the Plus button. Backends are the applications where Front Door service will route the traffic. In our case, we will have two backends, two web applications we created before. From the Backend host type drop‑down, select App service. Let's leave Subscription as it is. From the Backend host name drop‑down we select pswebappregion1.azurewebsites.net. We can leave the rest of the default settings. Then we click the Add button. Now it's time to add a second backend. To do it we click Add a backend. From the Backend host type we select App service. Subscription stays as it is. From the Backend host name drop‑down we select pswebappregion2.azurewebsites.net. We can leave the rest of the default settings and click the Add button. Next, we can scroll down and select the Add button without changing any other settings. Oh, one important thing, we have to provide the name for the new backend pool. In this case, psBackendPool. Now, we click the Plus button on the Routing rules. We have to provide the name. In this case, it will be psRoutingRule. Then, Accepted protocol should be set to HTTP and HTTPS because we would like to load balance the HTTP traffic to our web applications. Now we can scroll down and make sure that the Backend pool is set to the previously created one, so psBackendPool. We can leave all other default settings and click the Add button. Once everything is set as it should be, we can click the Review + create button. After validation we can click the Create button. To avoid waiting until resources are provisioned, I forwarded the video. Once the Front Door service is created, we can access its URL. Let's copy it and paste in the new tab in the browser. Please note that web app will not be displayed immediately after creation. After a few minutes Front Door should be configured. We can try to open the URL once again. This time the welcome page from the Azure web app should be displayed. Now to test the failover we can try to disable the web app in the first region. To do it we have to click the Stop button. Once the web app in the first region is disabled we can try once again to open the URL for the Front Door. We can try to refresh the website a few times. It's still available because of automatic failover to the web app in the second region."

I hope you found it interesting and helpful. Building resilient and high‑available solutions on the Microsoft Azure cloud can be much easier when we know some features that services offer, like active geo‑replication in the Azure SQL Database or multi‑region writes in the Cosmos DB.
